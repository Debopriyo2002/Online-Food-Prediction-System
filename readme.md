# Online Food Prediction System

## Introduction
This project analyzes and predicts the likelihood of customers ordering food online based on various demographic factors. It leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will order again or not.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
The code includes data analysis and visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly. It explores customer demographics such as age, family size, gender, marital status, income group, and feedback to understand their ordering behavior.

## Machine Learning Model
The project builds a Random Forest Classifier model to predict if a customer will order food online again. It preprocesses the data by converting categorical features into numerical values and then trains the model.

## Usage
To use the prediction model, enter the details of the customer's demographic information when prompted, and the model will predict whether the customer is likely to order food online again.

## System Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
